// XFAIL: *

// OPEN BUG (CLANG-8 in this fork's bug-reports/): `this` is accepted in the
// NOEXCEPT-SPECIFIER of an explicit object member function.
//
// [expr.prim.this]/3, as amended by P0847R7: `this` "shall not appear within
// the declaration of either a static member function or an explicit object
// member function of the current class".
//
// THIS ROW IS CLANG-ONLY. Measured 2026-09-05: GCC rejects it correctly and
// only accepts the trailing-return-type row, so the gnu_gcc mirror expects a
// real diagnostic here rather than xfailing it. Same test content, opposite
// expectation -- which is why the mirror is worth having.
