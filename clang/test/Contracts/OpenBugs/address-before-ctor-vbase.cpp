// Forming the address of a subobject before its construction has begun is not
// a core constant expression: [class.cdtor]/1 makes referring to a member or
// base of an object with a non-trivial constructor, before that constructor
// begins, undefined.
//
// Clang gets THIS shape right, and this test pins that it keeps doing so.
// Its mirror in the gnu_gcc fork --
// gcc/testsuite/g++.dg/contracts/cpp26/open-bug-address-before-ctor.C -- is
// xfailed for the same shape, because GCC accepts it (GCC-2 there).  Same
// content, per-compiler expectation.
//
// See also address-before-ctor-member.cpp in this directory, the shape both
// compilers get wrong.
//
// No contracts involved; pure core-language constexpr.
