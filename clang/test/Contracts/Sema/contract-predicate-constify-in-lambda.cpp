// [expr.prim.id.unqual]/3+d reaches inside a lambda that appears in the
// predicate: the paragraph's own example marks `++n`, on a namespace-scope
// `int n`, an error inside `pre([=,&i,*this] mutable {...})`.
//
// The variable cases follow from getContractConstification carrying no
// automatic-storage restriction.  GCC needs a dedicated fix for the lambda
// case, because its gate asks whether the INNERMOST binding level is the
// contract scope, which stops being true the moment a lambda pushes its own;
// Clang's does not ask that, so most of this file is a regression pin here
// for a bug that is real on the other compiler.
//
// Two lambda-specific shapes can go wrong in opposite directions:
//
//   * a member reached through a CAPTURED `*this` must not be constified,
//     since /3+e marks `++this->z` and `++z` "OK, captured *this" -- the rule
//     constifies a VARIABLE declared outside the assertion, and a non-static
//     data member of the captured object is not one; and
//   * a FUNCTION-LOCAL STATIC must be constified, being "a variable declared
//     outside of C" like any other.  Naming it DIRECTLY in a predicate is the
//     control kept below, which is what separates a lambda gap from a
//     storage-duration one.
