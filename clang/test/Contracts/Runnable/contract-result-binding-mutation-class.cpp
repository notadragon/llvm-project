// A mutation through a postcondition's result binding is observable for a
// CLASS-typed result, however the ABI returns it.
//
// Be precise about what is and is not going on, because "the binding names a
// copy" sounds much worse than it is:
//
//   * For a class with a NON-TRIVIAL copy constructor or destructor, no
//     temporary is introduced at all -- the binding names the returned object
//     itself and no extra construction or destruction is observable.
//     [dcl.contract.res] Example 2's `B' row requires that, and
//     contract-result-binding-mutation.cpp pins the object counts.
//   * For a TRIVIALLY-copyable class, both compilers introduce a temporary,
//     which Example 2's `A' row expressly permits and which costs no
//     constructor call.
//
// The bug was what happened after that temporary: Clang returned a value it
// had materialised BEFORE running the postconditions, so a write the
// predicate made into the return slot was dropped.  For a class the value is
// usually COERCED out of the slot -- { i64, i64 } for a four-int struct, i32
// for a one-int struct -- so re-reading the slot is not a plain load, which is
// why the first fix covered only scalars.  Redo the coercion instead.
//
// A genuinely sret-returned class needed nothing: the callee writes the
// caller's object directly.  It is covered anyway, since which of the three
// paths a given class takes is an ABI detail nobody should have to re-derive.
//
// RUN: %clangxx -std=c++26 %s -fcontracts %libcxx_flags -o %t && %t
