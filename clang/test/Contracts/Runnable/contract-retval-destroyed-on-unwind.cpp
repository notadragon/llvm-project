// Once the returned object has been initialized, unwinding must destroy it --
// exactly once.  This test covers the contracts route to that; see the note at
// the bottom for the core-language route, which Clang still gets wrong.
//
// A contract-violation handler that throws out of a POSTcondition check.
// [stmt.return]/5 sequences postcondition evaluation after the destruction of
// local variables, so the returned object exists by then.  No wording requires
// its destruction -- [except.ctor]/2 names only temporaries and local
// variables, and [basic.contract.eval] says the behaviour is "as if the
// function body exits via that same exception", describing a state in which
// the result object was never initialized.  We destroy it anyway; leaking an
// object the program can no longer reach is not a defensible reading.
//
// A core issue has been filed for this at
// <https://github.com/cplusplus/cwg/issues/988> (it has no CWG issue number
// yet), proposing that [except.ctor]/2 be extended to cover an exception
// escaping the evaluation of a postcondition assertion.  Until that resolves,
// this test deliberately runs ahead of the wording: do NOT "fix" it back to
// expecting a leak on the strength of the wording as it stands.
//
// GCC does the same, via g++.dg/contracts/cpp26/contract-retval-destroyed-on-
// unwind.C, so the two compilers agree here.
//
// Every case counts constructions against destructions, so a leak and a double
// destroy both fail.
//
// STILL BROKEN, DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED HERE: the core-language case, where
// an ordinary local variable's destructor throws after the returned object has
// been initialized and no contract is involved at all.  [except.ctor]/2
// requires the returned object to be destroyed then -- "If an exception is
// thrown during the destruction of temporaries or local variables for a return
// statement, the destructor for the returned object (if any) is also invoked"
// -- and Clang leaks it, in plain C++17.  GCC handles it, via
// current_retval_sentinel.  Fixing it needs a cleanup live across the whole
// body, which today would make requiresLandingPad() true from function entry
// and turn every potentially-throwing call into an invoke; that wants a gate
// on the body containing a potentially-throwing destructor first.  Tracked as
// a separate core-language bug with its own reproducer.
//
