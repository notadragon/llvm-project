// A mutation performed through a postcondition's result binding is observable
// by the caller.
//
// This branch's position (2026-09-02): a predicate we evaluate is evaluated
// faithfully, so its effects stand.  [basic.contract.eval] permits *not
// evaluating* a predicate -- "an alternative evaluation that produces the same
// value ... but has no side effects" may be substituted -- but that is
// all-or-nothing.  It does not permit evaluating a predicate and then
// discarding what it did.
//
// Clang used to discard it.  EmitPostContracts stores the return value into
// the return slot and binds the result name there, so the predicate's write
// landed in the slot correctly -- but the epilogue had already materialised
// the value it was about to return, and returned that stale copy.  The fix is
// to re-read the slot after the postconditions have run.  GCC makes the same
// mutations observable (gnu_gcc 20eed05e8c4 / 0377d4408ab).
//
// This file covers results returned directly.  A CLASS-typed result is still
// bound to a copy and its mutations are still lost; that gap is pinned
// separately in contract-result-binding-mutation-class.cpp.
//
// RUN: %clangxx -std=c++26 %s -fcontracts %libcxx_flags -o %t && %t

// and destructor calls, so the counts are pinned, not just the address.

// (Example 2's `A' row permits a temporary for a result the implementation
// returns by other means, and both compilers do introduce one for a
// TRIVIALLY-copyable class -- where it costs no constructor call and is
// unobservable except that a mutation through it is lost.  That is what
