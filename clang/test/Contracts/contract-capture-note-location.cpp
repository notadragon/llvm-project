// Mirror of g++.dg/contracts/cpp26/contract-capture-note-location.C.
//
// A contract assertion may not cause a capture that exists only for it, and
// the diagnostic for that carries notes.  On the GCC side the note's location
// was read out of the capture's initializer, which stops being a DECL once
// the capture crosses two lambdas, giving a garbage line number (and a
// tree-check ICE in a checking build).
//
// Clang has never had that bug -- it does not build the note from the
// capture initializer at all.  This test exists as a regression pin: every
// diagnostic below is anchored to the line it belongs on, so a location that
// went wrong would stop matching.  Two and three levels of nesting are
// covered because a one-level-only fix would still be wrong at three, and
// generic lambdas are covered because the original upstream report blamed
// them and they are in fact irrelevant to the GCC bug.  Clang reaches a
// different diagnostic for the generic case -- the odr-usable rule, at
// instantiation -- and that one does carry "'x' declared here" notes, which
// is the exact note class GCC got wrong, so it is worth pinning here too.
//
// RUN: %clang_cc1 -std=c++26 -fcontracts -fsyntax-only -verify %s
